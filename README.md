## Summary of Concepts

### 1. **Evaluation of Programming Languages**
- **Purpose**: Understanding why we study programming languages and how to evaluate them.
- **Key Focus Areas**: Readability, efficiency, and domain suitability.

### 2. **The C Programming Language**
- **Overview**: A foundational language for systems programming.
- **Core Features**: Efficiency, low-level access, and direct memory management.

### 3. **Syntax and Semantics**
- **Syntax**: The rules and structure of programming languages.
- **Semantics**: The meaning and interpretation of code constructs.
- **Application**: Used in compilers for lexical analysis and parsing.

### 4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Core Concepts**: Encapsulation, inheritance, and modular design.
- **Applications**: Facilitating the development of large, complex projects.

### 5. **C++ Programming Language**
- **Enhancements Over C**: Introduction of OOP, templates, and the STL.
- **Use Cases**: Performance-intensive applications and software requiring low-level access.

### 6. **Type Systems**
- **Definition**: Framework for defining and enforcing data types in programming languages.
- **Importance**: Ensures correctness and robustness in programs.

### 7. **JavaScript**
- **Overview**: The significance of JavaScript in modern programming.
- **Key Features**: Dynamic typing, asynchronous programming, and REST API interaction.

### 8. **Functional Programming**
- **Core Concepts**: Immutability, higher-order functions, and declarative paradigms.
- **Benefits**: Improved readability, testability, and parallelism.

## Project Highlights

### Project 1: **C Notebook - WAV File Reverser**
**Objective**: Work with data in C to manipulate WAV audio files.
- **Overview**: Read a WAV file, copy its metadata, and reverse its audio samples to create a backward-playing version.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Copy the first 44 bytes (metadata) to a new file.
  - Reverse the samples without disrupting their structure.
- **Example**:
  ```
  Original: | 00 01 | 02 03 | 04 05 |
  Reversed: | 04 05 | 02 03 | 00 01 |
  ```

### Project 2: **Custom Language with Flex and Bison**
**Objective**: Build a custom programming language using **Flex** and **Bison**.
- **Overview**: Designed a simple custom language, exploring syntax, semantics, and functionality.
- **Key Skills**:
  - Lexical analysis with **Flex**.
  - Grammar and parsing rules with **Bison**.

### Project 3: **OOP Game in C++ - Phineas and Ferb Adventure**
**Objective**: Apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++ by developing a text-based game.
- **Overview**: A Phineas and Ferb-themed adventure game with audio integration for an immersive experience.
- **Key Features**:
  - Encapsulation, inheritance, and modular design.
  - Integrated audio prompts for user interactions.
- **Running the Game**:
  - Navigate to the `project3-zork` directory.
  - Build using `Ctrl + Shift + B`.
  - Run the game executable.

### Project 4: **Terminal-Based Pokedex (In Progress)**
**Objective**: Learn JavaScript and REST API calls by building a simple terminal-based Pokédex.
- **Overview**: A CLI program that retrieves and displays Pokémon data using REST APIs.
- **Features (Planned)**:
  - Fetch Pokémon details such as name, type, and stats.
  - Enable search functionality to find specific Pokémon.
- **Current Progress**: Basic API integration for retrieving Pokémon data.

## Lessons Learned

This semester provided hands-on experience with:
- **C**: Low-level programming and data manipulation.
- **Flex and Bison**: Basics of programming language design and implementation.
- **C++**: Object-Oriented Programming and application development.
- **JavaScript**: REST API interactions and terminal-based programming.

By integrating theoretical concepts with practical projects, this course emphasized the importance of understanding programming paradigms, data structures, and language evaluation criteria, preparing us for real-world problem-solving.
